# Student Performance Predictor

## Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict students' final performance based on various academic, demographic, and socio-economic factors. The goal is to identify key factors influencing student success and develop a reliable predictive model using real-world data.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering and encoding categorical variables
- Model training using Random Forest Regressor
- Performance evaluation using RÂ² score
- Visualization of actual vs predicted results

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features such as student demographics, study habits, and other factors, along with their final grades.  
*(Include dataset source or upload dataset file if permitted)*

## Input
The input features used by the model include:
- Gender (Male/Female)
- Age
- Study time (hours per week)
- Failures (number of past class failures)
- Family support (Yes/No)
- Extra educational support (Yes/No)
- Absences (number of school absences)
- Other relevant academic and demographic data

*Inputs can be provided as a CSV file with the above features or manually for prediction in the program.*

## Output
The output is the predicted final grade of the student, typically represented as a numerical score or grade point.  
Additionally, visual plots compare the actual vs predicted grades to show model accuracy.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance-predictor.git
