# Student Performance Predictor

## Project Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict students' final performance based on various academic, demographic, and socio-economic factors. The goal is to identify key factors influencing student success and develop a reliable predictive model using real-world data.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Feature engineering and encoding categorical variables  
- Model training using Random Forest Regressor  
- Performance evaluation using R² score and Mean Squared Error  
- Visualization of actual vs predicted results  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Dataset

The dataset contains various features such as student demographics, study habits, and other factors, along with their final grades.  
*(Include dataset source or upload dataset file if permitted)*

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance-predictor.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd student-performance-predictor
    ```

3. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:

    - On Linux/Mac:

      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

    - On Windows:

      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

4. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Student_Performance_Predictor.ipynb
    ```

6. Follow the instructions inside the notebook to input student data and get predictions.
